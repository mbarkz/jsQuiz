# Project Title
Java Script Quiz Game

## Description
The intent was for this app to function as a Java Script Quiz.

I did succeed with some elements of the project such as setting the timer and navigating the DOM; creating media queries, creating classes, and appending text to the page.

I was able to make the program navigate through the questions sequentially and had some limited success with recording scores.

I however found that I coded my self into a bit of a corner, and with out largely restarting the project I could not proceed.

My learning for next time would be to create an object array for my questions - but at the time I could not figure this out either.
